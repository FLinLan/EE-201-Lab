This is my personal page for my first assignment in EE201

**About Me**
I'm a second year student planning to specialize in computing and trying to work in the software engineering industry once I graduate, hopefully as a backend or a full stack software engineer. I'm currently in a club called Web Impact, which focuses on web development skills and online projects. Here is my LinkedIn page if you want to connect with me!

For my free time, I like to play video games, and read books that interests me.
